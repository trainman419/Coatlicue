Label format:
  tuple of ints; index successive arrays


Interpreter flow:
  notes on conditionals:
    conditionals are evaluated before the rest of the block
  some groups of statements evaluate as a group
    choices within a condition are part of the enclosing group of choices
  words (narration/speech/etc) execute immediately
  method calls execute immediately

Methods:
  anything that is an expression with more than one word is interpreted as a
    series of method calls. ex: foo bar baz => foo(bar(baz))
  methods are limited to one argument
  currently no syntax to define methods
