Internal label format:
  tuple of ints; index successive arrays
  optional argument to exec() specifies starting index


Interpreter flow:
  notes on conditionals:
    conditionals are evaluated before the rest of the block
    conditionals should execute before:
      choices
      randoms
  some groups of statements evaluate as a group
    choices within a condition are part of the enclosing group of choices
  words (narration/speech/etc) execute immediately
  method calls execute immediately


Methods:
  anything that is an expression with more than one word is interpreted as a
    series of method calls. ex: foo bar baz => foo(bar(baz))
  methods are limited to one argument
  currently no syntax to define methods


Proposed language modifications:
  Invert nesting of choices and conditionals
    doesn't allow multiple children of a conditional
    makes it easier to run blocks; can execute in-order
    harder to express multiple conditions
